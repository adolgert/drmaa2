Introduction

DRMAA2 is version 2 of the Distributed Resource Management
Application API. It is an API for controlling unix processes
on a cluster or for controlling meta-clusters of unix processes.
The detailed API description is a document called
`GFD.194.pdf <https://www.ogf.org/ogf/doku.php/documents/documents>`_
from the `Open Grid Forum <http://ogf.org>`_.
Looking at the
`Go implementation <https://github.com/dgruber/drmaa2/blob/master/drmaa2.go>_`
can help, too.
You also might need to look at
`Daniel Gruber's blog <http://www.gridengine.eu/index.php/programming-apis/178-the-drmaa2-tutorial-introduction-1-2013-10-05>`_.
